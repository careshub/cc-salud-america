===Take Action:

One word can describe Taco Bell’s drink lineup: Sugary

Taco Bell recently added six new sugary drinks and became the first fast-food giant to offer Manzanita Sol, an apple-flavored soda most popular in Mexico, a nod to its Latin-inspired cuisine.

Manzanita Sol packs a whopping 56 grams of sugar in a 16-ounce drink, and four of the six new drinks contain more than 20 grams of sugar in the chain’s smallest available size.

Tell Taco Bell to stop adding sugary drinks, and instead add a healthy option like no- or low-fat milk!

Old campaigns:
=Tell Kellogg: Stop Marketing High-Sugar Recipes to Latino Families

More than 23,000 people across the nation recently wrote letters to urge the Kellogg Co. to stop marketing sugary foods to Latino families on their Dias Grandiosos website.
The letters, collected in February and March 2015, highlighted how Kellogg’s targets Latina moms with cultural- and family-oriented messages for meals that are high in sugar and salt.

Latino families need healthy food options—rather than many of the recipes promoted to them on Kellogg’s Dias Grandiosos website, where 19 of the 29 recipes qualify as desserts based on their high sugar content, according to an independent nutritionist.

=We Need Your Help to Get Sugary Drinks Out of Summer Camps!
Girls on an insect safari in a field
Will your child’s summer camp give them healthy drinks, or sugary drinks, like “bug juice”?
The American Camp Association (ACA), the country’s leading camp resource and accreditation group, requires camps to take many steps to ensure the safety and well-being of young people. They also offer suggestions on how camps can help kids be active and eat healthy foods.

But ACA does NOT require camps to have a healthy beverage policy to gain accreditation.

In Summer 2014, more than 13,000 people signed letters to tell the ACA they should take our children’s health seriously and add a “no sugary drinks” rule to their camp accreditation standards.

The outgoing CEO, Peg Smith, said she shared the letters with the ACA Board of Directors in October 2014: “They applaud your commitment to address obesity rates in children. I believe you would be pleasantly surprised to discover that the preponderance of camps in ACA have been making significant strides in their nutritional offerings the past decade. The days of bug juice are gone.”
